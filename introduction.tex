\begin{itemize}
\item Modern simulations have taken a number of approaches to solving the problem of
accurately modelling the effects of stellar feedback. Past work has had great
success showing the effect of feedback on galaxy evolution.  
\item Despite this, as computing power has pushed the resolution of simulations 
higher, the need for a feedback model that can treat resolved star clusters has 
become apparent.
\item Previous studies of wind and supernova driven superbubbles (Chevalier 1974, Mac Low
\& McCray 1988, etc.) include thermal conduction as a key component.
\item We show that the thermal conduction can have a significant effect on the
evolut
