Stellar feedback is both a source of energy and chemical enrichment for the ISM.  It creates pressure reservoirs (associated with HII regions, winds, SNe, etc.) that are difficult to resolve and model explicitly in galaxy-scale simulations. The feedback-heated ISM fills roughly half of the volume in the galaxy but a tiny fraction of the ISM mass. It is well known (e.g. Thacker & Couchman 2000) that adding the energy released by SNe as a spatially-averaged thermal energy results in overcooling compared to the explicit multiphase state observed in real SNe. In order to accurately model this small-scale (both temporally and spatially), the small-scale behaviour must be well understood.  In this poster, we show the results of high-resolution simulations that include thermal conduction, and exhibit Vishniac instabilities.  The behaviour of these small-scale simulations will be essential to generate accurate sub-grid models of stellar feedback in larger-scale, lower resolution simulations.
