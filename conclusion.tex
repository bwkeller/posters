The amount of mass that feedback energy is deposited in is ultimately
	set by conduction, not by ejecta from the star cluster.  Omitting
	conduction causes one to underestimates bubble mass by an order of magnitude.

This also sets the temperature of the bubble.  Omitting conduction
	causes one to overestimate bubble temperature by an order of magnitude.

Simulations of superbubble growth must include conduction in order to
	accurately model their growth.
