	\item The amount of mass that feedback energy is deposited in is ultimately
		set by conduction, not by ejecta from the star cluster.  Omitting
		conduction causes one to underestimates bubble mass by an order of magnitude.
	\item This also sets the temperature of the bubble.  Omitting conduction
		causes one to overestimate bubble temperature by an order of magnitude.
	\item Simulations of superbubble growth must include conduction in order to
		accurately model their growth.
